                The following bestiary was first discovered in the papers of Doris Smealler. The early entries were written
                in a highly calligraphic style and the illustrations were done with pen and ink. At present, the papers and illustrations are
                far too fragile for even digital reproduction. The work was then continued by her nephew, Laird Smealler. The words are still
                Doris’s but we have used Laird’s images which were stored on floppy disks—a type of storage device that was highly destructible. 
                <br>
                After Laird's death, the papers and floppy disks were bequeathed to the Institute for the Discovery and Dissemenation of Data on
                the Existence of Computable Demons<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. They are presented in their original
                form without editing for use as historical context and should not be referenced or cited as fact. Any attempt to do so will be punished
                under the Warren Act. For a more up-to-date reference please see Mel Helmguard's Codex of Binary<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> Creatures.

                <p>The Assignment Abomination is a devilish creature with an affinity for unattended
                    screens. They love to hide behind popup windows in your browser, and snack on uninitialized
                    variables. The abomination will often wait until the coder is ready to run the code and then
                    will eat all but one equality operator, causing the equality to read like an assignment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Assignment Abominations target new coders and experienced coders alike, and when caught in the act
                    will often make rude noises and obscene hand gestures. It can be extremely tempting for the coder 
                    to blame this mistake on themselves, increasing the coder’s imposter syndrome, but the coder must 
                    <em>never</em> accept blame for this. It is <em>always</em> the fault of the  Assignment Abomination.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The best way to keep this atrocity out of your code is to avoid using Booleans completely. Remember,
                    a demon-free code is the key to a prosperous life!

                <p>The Iteration Snatcher can be harder to catch than most computable demons. It lurks 
                    beneath the code and will extend only one tentacle at a time. Don’t be fooled into 
                    thinking that just because you only see one part of the Iteration Snatcher at a time 
                    that it is a lesser beast. Much like an iceberg, the true danger lies beneath the code.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The more loops you have in your code the more likely you are to run into an Iteration 
                    Snatcher. Nested loops are particularly dangerous. The best way to avoid this beast is 
                    to avoid complex data structures altogether. If you simply <em>must</em> deal with nested 
                    objects and arrays, then pay very close attention to your iterator keys. Make sure they’re 
                    in the right place, and that you reference your outer loop in your inner loop.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This wiley demon will not only still your [i] from your loop, at times it will 
                    place it in the wrong spot. Think you’re iterating through commands? Look again, 
                    that horrible monster has moved your [i] from your commands to your commandType. 
                    The fiend!<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you suspect that you have an Iteration Snatcher in your code, pay particular 
                    attention to the level of light in the room. The demon likes dark places so keep 
                    your workspace well-lit. Some have noticed the smell of overheated metal in the 
                    presence of a Snatcher. While that phenomenon cannot be substantiated, it&apos;s 
                    better to be safe rather than sorry and search your loops for any sign of tentacles.

                <p>The Infinity Demon is another loop creature. He is even more insidious than the 
                    Iteration Snatcher and more cruel than the Assignment Abomination. If this nasty 
                    beast gets into your code, beware—you will become stuck in an infinite loop, lost in 
                    space and time and you never, ever get out.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    No one can say what exactly an Infinity Demon looks like as anyone who has seen 
                    one is lost to the void. If you suspect that your code has attracted an Infinity 
                    Demon, throw it away and give up.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> Never 
                    try that piece of code again as you are likely to attract double the creatures than 
                    on your last attempt.

                <p>Doris was born in Wichita, Kansas to Emily and Ned Smealler. She graduated with top
                    honors from the Michigan Institute for Technological Innovation and Supernatural 
                    Inquiry and continued to innovate in both the field of abstract coding and micro-entity discovery.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She held numerous positions including Dean of Investigative Computing at Bailamos 
                    Universidad in Brazil where she wrote the now famous monograph on security issues 
                    involved with micro-entities and event handling.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sadly, most of the work in her later life should be disregarded as it was discovered 
                    during her autopsy that she suffered from advanced prion disease. On this discovery, and
                    on the insistence of her sister who claimed loudly and vociferously that Doris didn’t have 
                    a nephew, further investigation was launched into Laird Smealler.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A wide search was conducted, but he was not found until after his death. Laird Smealler was 
                    discovered in a roadside motel in Chippiwak, California. An autopsy revealed that Mr. 
                    Smealler was not human after all, but an Assignment Abomination in disguise. Whether Doris 
                    Smealler knew this is still a topic of hot debate at the annual conference on computable entities.
