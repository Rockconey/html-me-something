            <p>The following bestiary was first discovered in 2006 among the documents and floppy disks bequeathed
                to the Institute for the Discovery and Dissemenation of Data on the Existence of Computable Demons<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>

                <p>The <strong>Assignment Abomination</strong> is a particularly devilish creature. It has an affinity for dark
                    screens and loves to hide behined popup windows in your browser. They will often wait until 
                    the coder is ready to run their code and then will eat all but one '=' in a line of code, causing
                    the equality to read like an assignment. Assignment Abominations target new coders and experienced
                    coders alike, and when caught in the act will often make rude noises and obscene hand gestures.</p>

                <p>It can be extremely tempting for the coder to blame this mistake on themselves, increasing the 
                    coder's imposter syndrome. The coder must <em>never</em> accept blame for this. It is <em>always</em>
                    the fault of the Assignment Abomination.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>

                <p>The <strong>Iteration Snatcher</strong> can be harder to catch than most computable demons. It lurks beneath the code and will extend
                    only one tentacle at a time. Don&apos;t be fooled into thinking that because you only see a part of the Iteration Snatcher
                    at a time that it is a lesser beast. Much like an iceberg, the true danger lies beneath the code.</p>
                    
                <p>This wiley demon will not only steal your [i] from your loop, at times it will place it in the wrong spot. Think you&apos;re
                    iterating through commands? Look again, that horrible monster has moved your [i] from your commands to your commandType. The
