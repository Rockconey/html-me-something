            <p>The following bestiary was first discovered in the papers and floppy disks of Doris Smealler that were bequeathed
                to the Institute for the Discovery and Dissemenation of Data on the Existence of Computable Demons<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> after her death.
                They are presented in their original form without editing for use as a historical context.

                <h2>The Assignment Abomination</h2>

                <p>The <strong>Assignment Abomination</strong> is a particularly devilish creature. It has an affinity for dark
                    screens and loves to hide behined popup windows in your browser. They will often wait until 
                    the coder is ready to run their code and then will eat all but one '=' in a line of code, causing
                    the equality to read like an assignment. Assignment Abominations target new coders and experienced
                    coders alike, and when caught in the act will often make rude noises and obscene hand gestures.</p>

                <p>It can be extremely tempting for the coder to blame this mistake on themselves, increasing the 
                    coder's imposter syndrome. The coder must <em>never</em> accept blame for this. It is <em>always</em>
                    the fault of the Assignment Abomination.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>

                <h2>The Iteration Snatcher</h2>

                </figure>

                <p>The <strong>Iteration Snatcher</strong> can be harder to catch than most computable demons. It lurks beneath the code and will extend
                    only one tentacle at a time. Don&apos;t be fooled into thinking that because you only see a part of the Iteration Snatcher
                    at a time that it is a lesser beast. Much like an iceberg, the true danger lies beneath the code.</p>
                    
                <p>This wiley demon will not only steal your [i] from your loop, at times it will place it in the wrong spot. Think you&apos;re
                    iterating through commands? Look again, that horrible monster has moved your [i] from your commands to your commandType. The
                    fiend!<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> </p>

                <h2>The Infinity Demon<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></h2>

                </figure>

                <p>The Infinity Demon is another loop creature. He is even more insidious than the Iteration Snatcher
                    and more cruel than the Assignment Abomination. If this nasty beast gets into your code beware--you will
                    become stuck in an infinite loop, lost in space and time and you will never, ever get out.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></p>

                <p>No one can say what exactly an Infinity Demon looks like as there has never been anyone who has seen it and
                    been able to tell anyone else. If you suspect that your code has attracted an infinity demon, throw it away
                    and give up.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>
                </p>    
                <!--Also, a return statement eater. Should be something for each bit of code.-->

                </figure>

                <p>Doris was born in Witchita Kansas to Emily and Ned Smealler. She graduated with top honors form
                    the Michigan Institute for Technological Innovation and Supernatural Inquiry and continued to innovate
                    in both the field of abstract coding and Micro-Entity discovery.</p>

                <p>Sadly, most of the work in her later life should be disregarded as it was discovered during her autopsy
                    that she suffered from advanced prion disease.
